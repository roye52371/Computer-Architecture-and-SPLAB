# Computer-Architecture-and-SPLAB
This Repository contains: assigments and labs from Computer Architecture and SPLAB Course.

1. different labs tasks of differnet principles in C and Assembly.

2. Project that simulates a drone game on board (written in assembly), which according to num of drones ,targets, speed drone,round to print,cycles for elimination ,etc,

score,speed,location on board,num of target destroyed.
every time after the cycle that given past,one drom=ne eliminate, until one drone left and win.(no graphics, only printing on the screen the appropriate details).
